FYI:
This is only a POC app, hence some dev priciples are not keeped

Currently missing part is implementation and integration of ChatActivity and related stuff.

Currently it has 'structure' for representation chat messages however implementation of mock chat scanario 
is missing.

In order to enter to ChantActivity just write a couple of chars within EditText of MainFragment and click GO
